# TimeSyncedBLE

A system for taking syncronised accelerometer measurements with a network of BLE (Bluetooth Low-Energy) nodes in a way that all measurements are time-stamped to better than 1 millisecond accuracy. It builds on the time-syncing system pioneered by Audun Korneliussen (https://github.com/nordic-auko).

The nodes are implemented on nRF52 SOC (for example, nRF52832) and uses the ST accelerometers LIS2DH. A controller nRF52 provides the time sync to all leaf nodes, and also acts as a relay for getting the data back to a host PC.

Several sources of code have been borrowed:

* Time-sync framework from https://github.com/nordic-auko/nRF5-ble-timesync-demo. More details are given in the blogs here https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/nordic/short-range-guides/b/bluetooth-low-energy/posts/wireless-timer-synchronization-among-nrf5-devices
* Relay code for the "controller" to relay between the leaf nodes and the PC taken from an example in the Nordic SDK examples\ble_peripheral_and_central\experimental\ble_app_relay_hrs_rscs.

## Development Frameworks

Embedded code for the nRF52 units uses the 16.0.0 version of the nRF52 (download from https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Software/nRF5-SDK/Download). It should be compilable by SES. Note that the SDK is not included in this repository -- it must be downloaded and copied in. There is an empty directory there for it.

PC host code uses Python 3.6 + Bleak 0.7.1. It should work independently of hardware - for development, Ubuntu 18.04 was used with Bluetooth LE adaptor Adafruit #1327.
